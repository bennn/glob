glob
====

String-based API for globbing in Racket.

This package is __deprecated__ since the [`file/glob`](http://docs.racket-lang.org/file/glob.html) collection materialized in Racket.
See the [`v6.6`](https://github.com/bennn/glob/tree/6.6) branch for the most recent non-deprecated release of this `glob` package.
